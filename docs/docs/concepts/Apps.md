# Apps

Scoop uses the term **App** to refer to an application or program to be installed. You might also see it used to loosely refer to a [manifest](App-Manifests.md) that describes how to install an app.

An app is a self-contained, independent unit. It contains one or more executables or scripts. But that's probably too much of an explanationâ€”generally you'll know an app when you see it.

Probably the main reason for the term 'app' is that it only takes 3 keystrokes on 2 keys to type.
