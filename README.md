[Scoop documentation](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki) done right, featuring:

- No-fresh navigation
- Instant documentation search
- Blazing fast app search for known buckets
  - We use Travis CI to index apps **everyday**
  - We love [Scoop Directory](https://github.com/rasa/scoop-directory) too, we'll soon provide categories like that

## There's already [Better documentation for Scoop.sh](https://github.com/pakeweb/scoop.sh).

But it has not been active for a long time and lacks the latest information. And it'll be better there's one ring to rule them all - docs, apps, buckets, so here it is.

We will continue to add features. I hope in the future it can become a home for Scoop-related stuff.

## Development

- Setup `yarn`
- Run `yarn dev`
- Build `yarn build`
