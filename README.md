[Scoop documentation](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki) done right, plus app search for known buckets & more!

## There is [Better documentation for Scoop.sh](https://github.com/pakeweb/scoop.sh) already...

Since it has not been active for a long time, I decided to build another documentation site (check it out). Currently it features:

Docs: merged the latest wiki, README and https://scoop.sh/.
Apps: real-time app manifest search for known buckets (whether built-in or not). No more struggle (partly) in https://github.com/rasa/scoop-directory!
We will continue to add buckets for app manifest search and bucket search is on the way. I hope in the future it can become a new home for Scoop-related stuff.

## Development

- Setup `yarn`
- Run `yarn dev`
- Build `yarn build`
