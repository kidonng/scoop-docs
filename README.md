[Scoop documentation](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki) done right, plus app search for known buckets & more!

## We already have [Better documentation for Scoop.sh](https://github.com/pakeweb/scoop.sh)...

It has not been active for a long time and is lacking latest information, so I decided to build this yet another documentation site. Currently it features:

- Docs: contents from the latest wiki, repository README and official website.
- Apps: real-time app manifest search for known buckets (whether built-in or not). No more struggle (partly) in [Scoop Directory](https://github.com/rasa/scoop-directory)!

We will continue to add buckets for app manifest search and bucket search is on the way. I hope in the future it can become a new home for Scoop-related stuff.

## Development

- Setup `yarn`
- Run `yarn dev`
- Build `yarn build`
