# Criteria for including apps in the main bucket

For an app to be acceptable for the [main bucket](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main), it should be:

- A reasonably well-known and widely used developer tool
- The latest stable version of the program
- The full version i.e. not a trial version
- A fairly standard install (e.g. uses a version-specific download URL, no elaborate pre/post install scripts)
- A non-GUI tool
