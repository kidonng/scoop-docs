# So What?

## Why should you care about Scoop?

If you identify with lots of the following statements, then Scoop has been designed with you in mind.

- You're a programmer/developer
- You want to set up a machine without having to visit a bunch of websites, download installers and then click through each one
- You're comfortable working on the command line, especially with tools like Git
- You're familiar with UNIX tools, and you wish there were more of them on Windows
- You read Hacker News and you feel like you're 'stuck' on Windows and missing out on lots of cool things
- You wish there was an easier way to tell other developers how to install programs (maybe your own programs)
- You use Homebrew/apt-get and think, "this is awesome".

## What does Scoop feature?

- Lets you script your development/production environment setup (repeatable!)
- Installs tools so they 'just work', the way they work on other platforms (e.g. SSH)
- Lets you stay on the command line, where you can work fast
- Extends PowerShell so you can use programs that work really well with text, the universal interface.
- Lets you sharpen skills that transfer to Linux and macOS

## But I already use X, why should I use Scoop?

There are similar tools available, like [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org), [Ninite](http://ninite.com) and [CoApp](http://coapp.org). While there's a more in-depth comparison with Chocolatey [here](Chocolatey-Comparison.md), here are some general reasons why you might like to try Scoop.

Scoop:

- avoids GUIs whenever possible, keeps you on the command line
- installs to your home directory by default (thereby avoiding UAC popups, and other people messing up your setup)
- installs applications independently and in a self-contained way (which means less conflicts, easy to undo installs)
- doesn't pollute your path
- has a command interface similar to Git and similar tools
- makes it easy to discover commands that you don't know, or have forgotten
- makes it easy to tell people how to install your programs
- has a curated collection of apps, while at the same time...
- makes it easy to create your own apps and collections of apps
- values your time and attention
- reads the README for you

There are other, less objective reasons to give Scoop a try. Maybe you want to be able to install apps without Admin privileges. Maybe you like Chocolatey but you don't like the name, or typing `cinst` feels weird, or you're not a fan of messages about "Chocolatey gods".
