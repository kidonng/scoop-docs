# Criteria for including apps in the main bucket

For an app to be acceptable for the main bucket, it should be:

- a reasonably well-known and widely used developer tool
- the latest stable version of the program
- the full version i.e. not a trial version
- a fairly standard install (e.g. uses a version-specific download URL, no elaborate pre/post install scripts)
- a non-GUI tool
