# Switching between Ruby and Python Versions

## `scoop reset`

If you need to run multiple versions of Ruby or Python on the same computer, you can use `scoop reset` to switch between versions.
If you're familiar with `rbenv` or RVM this is roughly similar, although with `scoop reset` you always need to switch version manually.

## Ruby

```powershell
scoop bucket add versions # add the 'versions' bucket if you haven't already

scoop install ruby ruby19
ruby --version # -> ruby 1.9.3p551 (2014-11-13) [i386-mingw32]

# switch to ruby 2.x
scoop reset ruby
ruby --version # -> ruby 2.3.3p222 (2016-11-21 revision 56859) [x64-mingw32]

# switch back to 1.9.x
scoop reset ruby19
ruby --version # -> ruby 1.9.3p551 (2014-11-13) [i386-mingw32]
```

`scoop reset` re-installs shims for the app and updates environment variables according to the app manifest.
You can switch between Ruby versions as many times as you likeâ€”both versions remain installed but one takes priority.

## Python

The same thing works for Python

```powershell
scoop bucket add versions # add the 'versions' bucket if you haven't already

scoop install python27 python
python --version # -> Python 3.6.2

# switch to python 2.7.x
scoop reset python27
python --version # -> Python 2.7.13

# switch back (to 3.x)
scoop reset python
python --version # -> Python 3.6.2
```
